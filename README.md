Last updated: 12/04/2023

This Privacy Policy describes how ThreadExpresso ("we", "us", or "our") handles your personal information when you use our Chrome Extension (the "Service"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using our Service.

By using the Service, you agree to the handling of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Information Handling

We do not collect any personal information from you. When you sign in with your Google account, we use the Chrome Identity API to store your email address locally in your browser storage. This information is used only to provide you with the premium features of our Service and to manage your access to the Service.

OpenAI API

Our Service uses the OpenAI API to provide summary features. We send data, including the content of tweets, to the OpenAI API for processing. We do not disclose any personally identifiable information (other than what is included in the tweets) to OpenAI.

Data Retention

Tweets and generated summaries may be retained on our server for 30 days. After this period, we securely delete this data from our server.

Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect any information we handle from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
